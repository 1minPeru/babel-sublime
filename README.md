## About

Under the hood, _6to5-sublime_ is based on the excellent [Benvie/JavaScriptNext.tmLanguage](https://github.com/Benvie/JavaScriptNext.tmLanguage) with JSX syntax support built on top. The initial definitions for JSX came from [reactjs/sublime-react](https://github.com/reactjs/sublime-react) via [yungters/sublime](https://github.com/yungsters/sublime.git) - but we've added a few improvements like support for [JSX namespaces](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/07/17/react-v0.11.html#jsx-namespacing) and comments between JSX attributes.
